As I've been using both [Kodi and Plex on my AppleTV 4](/2016/06/08/building-the-ultimate-home-media-center-with-the-new-appletv-4-plex/kodi-and-a-qnap-nas/) I thought I'd put together a short guide about which one to choose if you are considering doing the same.

There are many excellent comparisons out there and I won't try to repeat them here, I've just tried to highlight my own experiences from using both on the AppleTV 4.
