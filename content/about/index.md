This is the per­sonal web­site of Jeremy Brown so the thoughts and opin­ions on this blog are my own and not nec­es­sar­ily those of my employer.

I cur­rently work at Apigee where I lead the EMEA Pre­sales Engi­neer­ing team, here’s [my CV][1] if you want to know all the dry pro­fes­sional things about me; read on for the juicy stuff!<figure style="width: 388px;" class="wp-caption alignright">

**Why ten­fourty?** Peo­ple ask me that ques­tion so often I thought I’d answer that first. Ten­fourty is a vari­a­tion on the term “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10/40_Window" target="_blank">the 10/40 Win­dow</a>”, which describes an area of the globe in the east­ern hemi­sphere located between 10 and 40 degrees north of the equa­tor (see map), an area that in 1990 was pur­ported to have the high­est level of socioe­co­nomic chal­lenges. I was born in this area and have spent most of my life grow­ing up, liv­ing, work­ing and trav­el­ling in this area so it seemed like a pretty good handle/nickname to me in the early 90s when you had to have a “han­dle” on dial up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" target="_blank">Bul­letin Board Sys­tems</a> I used to visit in pre-Internet days. Nowa­days with the advent of Face­book most peo­ple seem to use their real names, but I still like my delib­er­ately mis­spelt handle.

Hav­ing a pro­fes­sion that only requires a lap­top and an Inter­net con­nec­tion I’ve been able to indulge in my pas­sion of being a global nomad. Though my ori­gins are Irish/Finnish I’ve spent lit­tle time in either coun­try.  <a href="http://2wheels2africa.com/" target="_blank">Trav­el­ling in West Africa</a> in 2008 I saw the pos­si­bil­i­ties there and I ended up [start­ing a com­pany][2] with a few friends in Cameroon. My time in Cameroon ended up being quite an expe­ri­ence, which will require a few blog posts to fully describe it. After spend­ing three years in Africa I’m now based in London.

I love all sorts of sports and have done a few seri­ously. I learnt to row while at school and rowed com­pet­i­tively while at uni­ver­sity and later on at a local club in Man­ches­ter. It’s allowed me to com­pete at the pres­ti­gious <a href="http://www.hrr.co.uk/" target="_blank">Hen­ley Royal Regatta</a> and I was even a cat­e­gory win­ner of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_the_River_Race" target="_blank">Head of the River Race</a> in Lon­don along with many other races. When I started trav­el­ling a lot for work I took up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fell_running" target="_blank">fell run­ning</a> and have com­pleted sev­eral marathons and ultra marathons both on and off-road since.

<span class="pullquote">I’ve been rid­ing motor­bikes for years and this pas­sion recently cul­mi­nated in tak­ing a sab­bat­i­cal year, while work­ing at Accen­ture, to ride through Africa on a motor­bike dur­ing 2008.</span> Check out <a href="http://www.2wheels2africa.com/" target="_blank">www.2wheels2africa.com</a> for more infor­ma­tion on that adventure.

I also enjoy fol­low­ing the other foot­ball team from Man­ches­ter, <a href="http://www.mcfc.co.uk/" target="_blank">Man City</a>. I devel­oped a taste for the roller coaster ride that is being a City fan while at Uni­ver­sity in Man­ches­ter when they were yo-yoing between the divisions.
