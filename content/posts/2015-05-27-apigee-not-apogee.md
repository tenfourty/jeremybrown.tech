[![Tweet: 1st day of my new job at @Apigee today, leaving @RedHatUK has been emotional but I'm super excited about the road ahead!](/uploads/Jeremy_Brown_on_Twitter___1st_day_of_my_new_job_at__Apigee_today__leaving__RedHatUK_has_been_emotional_but_I_m_super_excited_about_the_road_ahead__.png)][1]

I recently [left Red Hat][1] to join [Apigee][2] and one of the fun­ni­est things I get asked when I say this is if I’m going to make com­puter games!

Obvi­ously you won’t get this if you are not old enough or geeky enough to know it but [Apogee][3] was a com­pany that made really good share­ware com­puter games such as Duke Nukem and Wolfen­stein 3D.

It’s funny how one let­ter can make a dif­fer­ence — but no I’m not mak­ing games, instead I’m really excited to be at the heart of the Dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion that our cus­tomers are going through.

Here’s a great wee video of what we are actu­ally all about.
