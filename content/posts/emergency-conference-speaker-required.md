I had the slightly dubi­ous priv­i­lege this week of stand­ing in at the last-minute as a speaker at a Mil­i­tary con­fer­ence on secu­rity in Prague.

On Tues­day at 4:30pm I found out that we needed some­one to speak at a con­fer­ence in Prague the next day… slightly fool­ishly I vol­un­teered and 24 hours later I found myself presenting!

The con­fer­ence was the “Inter­na­tional Con­fer­ence ITTE 2011 — Cyber Secu­rity and Defense” - <http://www.afcea.cz/> My topic was “Open Source and Secu­rity: Engi­neer­ing Secu­rity by Design" and I had to brush up a bit on the con­tent as it’s not some­thing I had ever pre­sented on before.

Still it went OK I think and I enjoyed my brief 24 hours in Prague — though not to the 24 hours before sweat­ing and prep­ping for the talk and the panel dis­cus­sion that fol­lowed afterwards.

Here are my slides: [Open Source and Secu­rity: Engi­neer­ing Secu­rity by Design][1]
