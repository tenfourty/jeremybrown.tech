When I was think­ing of what this site used to look like I thought of the <a href="http://www.archive.org/web/web.php" target="_blank">Inter­net Archive’s Way Back Machine</a> and funny enough I found <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/tenfourty.com" target="_blank">tenfourty.com</a> on it. Who would have thought that a lowly per­sonal site would have a snap­shot kept for pos­ter­ity, hardly worth keep­ing around I would have thought.

It seems that the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060629205636/https://www.tenfourty.com/" target="_blank">29th of June 2006</a> was the last time there was con­tent on the site. I’m sure I have some back­ups of all those old posts — should I try and resurrect them?
