This is my first blog post in quite some time. I used to have a per­sonal web­site and blog on tenfourty.com quite some time ago, but I got really busy at work and stopped updat­ing it before even­tu­ally tak­ing it down when the con­tent got incred­i­bly stale. Since then my per­sonal domain, tenfourty.com, has been empty for years, not even a place­holder. I’ve recently had a bit of free time so I thought I would setup a sim­ple site using WordPress.

I prob­a­bly won’t update the site too often so please don’t be dis­ap­point­ed if I don’t blog too much, how­ever it is here and I guess I will occa­sion­ally write stuff or update the site.
