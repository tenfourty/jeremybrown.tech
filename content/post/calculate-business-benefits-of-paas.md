> Plat­form as a Ser­vice (PaaS) is a pow­er­ful cloud solu­tion that can help solve real prob­lems today. With PaaS you can enable your devel­op­ers to work faster and allow your oper­a­tions team to pro­vide real busi­ness value by reduc­ing time-to-market for key IT services.

I’d be inter­ested to hear how read­ers get on and it would be great if you could com­ment on this post with your results, anonymise your com­pany if you want, but it would be inter­est­ing to hear your thoughts on the results.
