Plex tries to make everything easy and simple and they have even built a beautiful [app for Apple TV](https://plex.tv/appletv). I tried using it with Plex Media Server running on my QNAP. It worked but I found it a bit slow talking to Plex on my NAS (or via SMB directly) and I don't like the way Plex asks you to pay.

Kodi is a bit different as it's not available directly on the Apple TV App Store (well there is a spin of it called [Infuse 4](https://firecore.com/infuse) that is available
